WAZIUP: Open Innovation Platform for IoT-Big data in Sub-Saharan Africa (Fev2016-Jan2019)

WAZIUP is an H2020 european collaborative research project using cutting edge technological research applications on IoT and related big data management and advanced analytic issues. The project brings liaison with the whole IoT European Research Cluster (IERC) and leading research and development organizations in Africa. The project is driven by a consortium of 5 EU partners and of 7 partners from 4 sub-Saharan African countries. It has support from multiple African stakeholders and public bodies with the aim of defining new innovation space to advance the African Rural Economy. The potential of IoT, in Sub-Saharan Africa, can only be realized if the cost is resolvable as most of the rural population in the Africa is at the poverty level. WAZIUP will take this challenge as the main one to be addressed.

This set of step-by-step tutorials is part of WP2 on "Open IoT Sensing and Communication Platform" describing in images how to build low cost IoT devices and gateways using the LoRa radio technology.

**RESSACS16-LPWAN-review.pdf** is a review of LPWAN technologies, focusing mainly on LoRa.

**smyle-deploying-low-cost-iot.pdf** is a summary of LPWAN, IoT and WAZIUP's objectives when deploying low-cost and long-range Internet of Things in developing countries. This presentation has been made at SMYLE event en September 2016. 

**FAQ.pdf** is our low-cost LoRa framework Frequently Asked Questions. It is advised to read it first.

**Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf** shows how to build a simple LoRa IoT sensing device with the simple temperature example and an Arduino Pro Mini, running on 4-AA battery for several months.

**Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-outdoor-step-by-step.pdf** shows how you can improve the design for out-door usage.

**Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-supported-sensors.pdf** explains in a didactic manner how physical sensors can be connected and how they can be integrated into our generic framework.

**Low-cost-LoRa-GW-step-by-step.pdf** shows how you can build and configure the LoRa gateway with a Raspberry PI to start pushing data to the cloud.

**Low-cost-LoRa-GW-web-admin.pdf** explains the web admin interface extension to easily configure and update your gateway.

**Low-cost-LoRa-ImageIoT-step-by-step.pdf** shows how you can build a long-range image sensor based on the Teensy32 and a 4D System uCamII camera. It also explains how the gateway receives and provides display features of the transmitted images. 

**RESSACS16-Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf** shows how you can use the gateway program to have a simple interactive sender node and how you can push data to cloud. This tutorial is kind of complementory to the **Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-step-by-step.pdf** tutorial.

**Low-cost-LoRa-Ghana-iSpace-public-event.pdf** is an other presentation on how to build low-cost IoT with our framework.

**Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-using-demo-kit.pdf** explains how to use the out-of-the-box gateway distribution [raspberrypi-jessie-WAZIUP-demo.dmg.zip](http://cpham.perso.univ-pau.fr/LORA/WAZIUP/raspberrypi-jessie-WAZIUP-demo.dmg.zip) and [Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp sketch](https://github.com/CongducPham/LowCostLoRaGw/tree/master/Arduino/Arduino_LoRa_Simple_temp) example.

**low-cost-iot-hardware-parts.pdf** lists all the parts you need to build both the low-cost device and the gateway.

**Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-using-demo-kit.pdf** explains how the WAZIUP long-range demo kit can be used for demonstration purposes.

**Low-cost-LoRa-IoT-antennaCable.pdf** is a tutorial on how to assemble an antenna cable with SMA and/or N connectors to match your antenna and radio module connectors. This is mainly required when you want to use a higher gain antenna or when you want to place the antenna outdoor and have your gateway indoor to simplify deployment.

**Low-cost-LoRa-Collar.pdf** shows a Cattle Rustling Use Case where a simple beacon collar is used for preventing cattle rustling.

There are also 2 tutorial videos on YouTube:

- [Build your low-cost, long-range IoT device with WAZIUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsKbJeeav_M)
- [Build your low-cost LoRa gateway with WAZIUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peHkDhiH3lE)

that show in images all the steps to build the whole framework from scratch.

Enjoy!
